# Common Coding Guidelines

General coding guidelines applicable across all programming languages.

## Code Quality Principles

- Write code that is easy to read and understand
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle - each function/class should do one thing well
- Keep functions and methods small and focused
- Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known (e.g., HTTP, URL)
- Make code self-documenting through clear naming and structure

## Code Structure

- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals
- Avoid deep nesting - maximum 3-4 levels
- Use guard clauses to handle edge cases early
- Keep cyclomatic complexity low
- Delete dead code - no commented-out code
- Remove unused variables, functions, and imports

## Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly - never silently ignore them
- Fail fast - validate inputs and preconditions early
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Use appropriate error types for different failure scenarios
- Clean up resources properly (files, connections, locks)

## Version Control

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits small and focused on a single change
- Review your own changes before submitting
- Don't commit sensitive data (passwords, API keys, secrets)
- Use .gitignore to exclude build artifacts and temporary files

## Security

- Never hardcode credentials or API keys
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Follow the principle of least privilege for file permissions
- Keep dependencies up to date to patch security vulnerabilities

## Performance Considerations

- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Consider time and space complexity for critical code paths
- Cache expensive operations when appropriate
- Close resources and clean up when done

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Keep tests independent and repeatable
- Make tests readable and maintainable
- Run tests before committing

## Documentation

- Write high-level comments explaining "why", not "what"
- Document complex algorithms and non-obvious decisions
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes
- Update documentation when changing code
- Use clear, concise language

## Collaboration

- Follow project conventions and style guides
- Be consistent with existing code style
- Review code changes carefully
- Provide constructive feedback in code reviews
- Keep pull requests focused and reasonably sized
- Respond to code review feedback promptly

## Maintainability

- Write code that you would want to maintain in 6 months
- Avoid clever tricks that obscure intent
- Refactor when you see opportunities for improvement
- Leave code better than you found it
- Document breaking changes clearly
