# TypeScript Coding Guidelines

TypeScript-specific coding standards for writing type-safe, maintainable code.

## Type Safety

- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json (`"strict": true`)
- Avoid using `any` type - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Define explicit return types for functions
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use union types and discriminated unions for polymorphic data

## Error Handling

- Use try-catch blocks for async/await operations
- Handle promise rejections explicitly
- Throw Error objects, not strings or primitives
- Create custom error classes for domain-specific errors
- Validate input parameters and fail fast

## Code Structure

- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid deep nesting (maximum 3-4 levels)
- Delete all dead code and unused imports
- Use const by default, let only when reassignment is needed
- Never use var

## Formatting and Style

- Use Prettier or ESLint for consistent formatting
- Follow project's naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/types)
- Use semicolons consistently (as per project configuration)
- Maximum line length should be reasonable (typically 100-120 characters)
- Use template literals for string interpolation

## Testing Standards

- Write tests using Jest, Vitest, or similar frameworks
- Use describe/it blocks for test organization
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test both success and error paths
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Use `expect` assertions with specific matchers

## Async/Await Best Practices

- Prefer async/await over raw promises for readability
- Always await promises or handle them explicitly
- Handle errors in async functions with try-catch
- Avoid mixing callbacks and promises

## Module Organization

- Use ES modules (import/export)
- Group imports: external libraries first, then internal modules
- Export only what needs to be public
- Keep module boundaries clear and cohesive

## Comments

- Write minimal comments - only high-level explanations
- Explain the "why", not the "what"
- Use JSDoc for public APIs
- Let TypeScript types document data shapes
- Remove commented-out code
